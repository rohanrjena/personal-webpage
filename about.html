            <p>Hi, I am Rohan</p>
            <p>I am currently persueing my enggineering in computer science from GITA Autonomous College, Bhubaneswar with a strong foundation in programming languages, data structures, and software development, proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js. I have completed projects involving web development. I am excited to contribute my technical skills and problem-solving abilities to drive innovation in the software development industry. My hobbies are riding bikes, wandering new places, listening to music, and watching movies. I enjoy exploring nature and discovering scenic routes and hidden gems on my bike. I love immersing myself in different cultures and experiences while traveling to new destinations. Music is a vital part of my life, inspiring my creativity and setting the mood for my adventures. I unwind by watching movies, which transport me into diverse narratives and spark new ideas. These hobbies not only bring me joy but also influence my perspective and contribute to my personal growth.</p>
